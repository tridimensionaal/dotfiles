# Arch setup
Files for arch installation.

- `arch/install.sh` is a basic, non-automatic script to set up my Arch environment. It is probably deprecated. I haven't checked it in a long time.
- `arch/user.conf` is a GNOME dconf export used by the install script.

## TODO
- [ ] Investigate ways to install arch with some post installations configurations or something like that.
- [ ] Automate the tasks currently handled by `arch/install.sh`.
