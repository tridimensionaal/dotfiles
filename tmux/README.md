# Tmux config

`tmux/tmux.conf` is my tmux configuration file.

## Notable settings
- Prefix key is `Ctrl+Space` (default `Ctrl+b` is unbound).
- Vim-style pane navigation with `h/j/k/l`.
- Copy mode uses vim keys: `v` to start selection, `C-v` rectangle toggle, `y` to copy.
- Splits and new windows open in the current pane directory.
- Uses TPM with: sensible defaults, vim navigator, dracula theme, and yank.
