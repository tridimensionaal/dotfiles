# Ubuntu setup

`ubuntu/install.sh` is a basic, non-automatic script to set up my Ubuntu environment. It is probably deprecated, I haven't checked it in a long time.

## TODO
- [ ] Investigate ways to install ubuntu with some post installations configurations or something like that.
- [ ] Automate the tasks currently handled by `ubuntu/install.sh`.
